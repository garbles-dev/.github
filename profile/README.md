## **Welcome to the world of Garbles!** üßô

Trash has become so abundant on the planet that humans don't know how to store it anymore. Luckily for us, a group of smart scientists (we call them Cleanetist) has found a way to cultivate goofy creatures that can help us!
 
Garbles are cute, clumsy creatures that originate from garbage and love eating it! Help them dove into our dumpsters and gobble up every plastic bottle they can find! Assemble an army of lovable Garbles and embark on a journey to populate the planet...while cleaning it!
